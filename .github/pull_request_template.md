## What changed and why

<!-- The why, not a restatement of the diff. A reviewer reads this to know what question the change answers. -->

## How it was verified

<!-- What you ran, and what it proved. "Tests pass" is not a verification; say which tests and what they cover. -->

- [ ] `dotnet format --verify-no-changes` clean
- [ ] `dotnet build -c Release` clean, warnings-as-errors on
- [ ] Unit tests green
- [ ] Integration tests green against the loopback listener (no credentials required)

## Checklist

- [ ] **Test-first** — the new test failed before the implementation; a bug fix reproduces the bug first
- [ ] **Docs in lockstep** — the affected section of the PRD (`R-#`), architecture doc, ADR, or README is
      updated *in this PR*
- [ ] **No secrets** — nothing logged, nothing tracked, no credential-shaped value in a committed file
- [ ] **Commits** are Conventional and carry both `Assisted-by:` and `Co-Authored-By:` trailers if AI-authored
- [ ] History is curated into units of work (this repo rebase-merges; squash is disabled)

## Token / error questions — answer if this touches auth, transport, or errors

<!-- Delete this section if it genuinely does not apply. If you are unsure whether it applies, it applies. -->

- [ ] The API token still travels as `Authorization: Token`, never a query-string parameter.
- [ ] A timeout or cancellation is treated as an **unknown** outcome, not a failure.
- [ ] Provider errors (including HTTP 429) still surface; nothing swallows them into empty news.

## Public surface

- [ ] No breaking change to the public API — **or** a major version bump and an ADR accompany it, because
      trading-copilot compiles against this assembly directly.
