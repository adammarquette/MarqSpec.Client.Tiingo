# Contributing

How we work in this repo. This is the contributor front door; the agent contract is
[`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md), and the reasoning behind individual decisions lives in
[`documentation/adr/`](documentation/adr/).

These practices are shared with
[trading-copilot](https://github.com/adammarquette/trading-copilot/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md), which consumes
this library as a submodule. Where the two differ, the difference is deliberate and noted below — this repo
ships a **package**, not a deployment, so it has a release ladder the parent does not.

## Branching model

**All new work branches off `develop`** and PRs back into it — `develop` is the sole integration branch. Changes
then promote up a one-way ladder, and **each step has exactly one allowed source**:

| Target | Allowed source | Exception |
|---|---|---|
| `develop` | any `feature` / `bug` branch | — |
| `staging` | **`develop` only** | state the reason in the PR **and** add the `ladder-exception` label |
| `main` | **`staging` only** | **none** |

The `ladder` check in [`.github/workflows/branch-policy.yml`](.github/workflows/branch-policy.yml) validates the
base/head pair on every PR into `staging` or `main`, and requires the head branch to live in **this** repository
— a fork branch merely *named* `staging` is a different lineage, so fork contributions go to `develop`, which
carries no ladder constraint. The `ladder-exception` label is the escape hatch made explicit and auditable — it
excuses a **branch** deviation into `staging`, never a foreign repository, and deliberately has **no equivalent
for `main`**.

**Never** branch off `main`, and never PR into it from anything but `staging` — release history stays
single-source, so every published package traces back through `staging`. Note the asymmetry: `staging` has an
escape hatch; `main` does not.

The rulesets enforce the merge *method* per rung, which is how the commit-history rules below stop being a
matter of discipline: **`develop` accepts rebase-merge only**, and **`staging` and `main` accept merge commits
only**. A promotion is a merge commit by construction; a feature landing is not.

**`hotfix` is deliberately absent from the table.** A published package cannot be unpublished, so an emergency
fix is a *new version*, not a shortcut through the ladder. Until that route is settled, raise a hotfix on its
issue rather than assuming one.

## Branch naming

Name every working branch:

```
<type>/<work-item-id>_<title>
```

- **`<type>`** — one of **`feature`**, **`bug`**, or **`hotfix`**.
- **`<work-item-id>`** — the tracking **GitHub issue number** (issue-first — the issue exists *before* the branch).
- **`<title>`** — a short, kebab-case summary.

Examples:

```
feature/20_agent-contracts
bug/57_retry-after-http-date
```

Work driven by a trading-copilot issue uses **that** issue number in the branch name.

## Claiming work — push the branch **before** you start

Sessions run in parallel, so **the branch is the claim**. Create and push it *empty*, before writing anything:

```bash
scripts/claim.sh <issue-id>          # check + worktree + branch + push, in one step
scripts/claim.sh <issue-id> --check  # report only
```

A claim whose branch tip has not moved for **4 hours** is presumed abandoned and is fair game. **Before taking
one over, say so on the issue**, naming the branch.

### This repo is one half of a two-repo card

Work here is frequently driven by an issue in **trading-copilot** — the code lands here and the parent only moves
its submodule pin. So the claim and the work can sit in different repositories, and checking one gives false
comfort. Before starting a venue-client card, check **both**:

```bash
gh pr list --repo adammarquette/MarqSpec.Client.Tiingo --state open
git ls-remote --heads https://github.com/adammarquette/MarqSpec.Client.Tiingo
```

**A clean `main` here is not "nobody started"** — work in review is on a branch, so a clean `main` reads as free
precisely when someone has *finished*. Claim in **both** repos, and do not delete the outer claim branch while
the inner PR is open.

Also delete a branch when your PR merged but the branch outlived it. Auto-delete-on-merge skips a branch that
received a commit after the merge, so a late push leaves the branch alive *and* refreshes its tip — it then looks
actively claimed indefinitely, and the late commit is orphaned onto no PR.

## Issue-first — no orphaned PRs

Every change starts from a **tracking issue** opened *before* the branch/PR; the PR references it (`Closes #N` /
`Related to #N`). A PR in **this** repo cannot close a trading-copilot issue — cite those with a fully-qualified
reference (`Related to adammarquette/trading-copilot#N`). Populate every field — assignee, milestone, `work:*`
and `Work Estimate` labels. Issues are the cards; a PR is not carded.

**The spec belongs in the issue**, never as a file under `documentation/` — a parallel spec duplicates the
tracker and drifts from it.

## Commits

- **[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)**. Accepted types:
  `build`, `chore`, `ci`, `docs`, `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `refactor`, `revert`, `style`, `test`.
  The commit *type* drives SemVer.
- AI-authored changes carry **both** trailers, in this exact form:

  ```
  Assisted-by: <Model Name> (<tool>)
  Co-Authored-By: <Model Name> <noreply@anthropic.com>
  ```

  Both, every time. The single-trailer and model-id-parenthetical variants that appear in the sibling repos are
  drift, not alternatives.
- **Docs move with the code — the same-PR rule:** any change whose behavior, API or configuration a doc
  describes updates **the affected section of that doc, in the same PR** — the PRD's `R-#`, the architecture
  doc, the ADRs, and the library README that ships inside the NuGet package. A PR that drifts is **not done**.

## Pull requests

- Open against **`develop`**; reference the tracking issue with a **plain** `Closes #N` (never backticked — a
  backticked keyword does not bind, and the issue will not auto-close). For a trading-copilot card, use
  `Related to adammarquette/trading-copilot#N` instead — GitHub will not close an issue in another repository
  from here.
- **Populate every field — maximal metadata.** Assignee, milestone, `work:*` + `Work Estimate` labels.
- **Reviews submit a verdict.** A reviewer leaves findings as comments and **Approves** or **Requests changes** —
  never a bare comment that leaves the state ambiguous. **Merging stays the maintainer's.**
- **Clean history — rebase-merge with curated commits.** A branch may carry several commits while in progress;
  before merge, interactive-rebase it into units of work — each commit a coherent, Conventional-typed package
  whose message carries the why. Squash-merge is disabled in the repo settings; true merge commits are reserved
  for the `develop → staging → main` promotions, and the rulesets enforce that.
- Before a PR: `dotnet format --verify-no-changes` and unit tests green. **Test-first is the Definition of Done**
  — no new public method without a failing test first.
- **Merge gate.** Rulesets protect `develop`, `staging` and `main`: each requires a pull request and green status
  checks before merge, and blocks force-push and deletion. `ladder` is additionally required on `staging` and
  `main`. Approvals are not required (single operator); the rulesets carry no bypass.

## Releases

**The tag is the version.** No file declares one; `MinVer` derives it from the nearest tag, so drift is not
possible rather than merely discouraged ([ADR-0001](documentation/adr/0001-tag-driven-versioning.md)).

1. Promote `develop → staging`, verify, then `staging → main`.
2. Tag `main` as **`vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`** — always the `v` prefix.
3. Publish a GitHub release from that tag. The release workflow packs, signs the version from the tag, pushes
   the `.nupkg` and its `.snupkg` to nuget.org, and waits on the `production` environment approval first.
4. Update `CHANGELOG.md` in the promotion PR, not afterwards.

Breaking changes to the public surface need a major bump **and** an ADR, because the parent repo compiles against
this assembly directly.

## Local development

```bash
dotnet format MarqSpec.Client.Tiingo.slnx --verify-no-changes
dotnet test MarqSpec.Client.Tiingo.slnx --filter "Category!=Live"
```

There is no in-process fake gateway in this repo. The unit suite stubs the HTTP transport; the integration
suite talks to a loopback listener and needs **no credentials**. Live-credentialed tests are opt-in and
separately tagged; see the [QA contract](MarqSpec.Client.Tiingo.IntegrationTests/AGENTS.md).
