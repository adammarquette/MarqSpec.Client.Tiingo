# AGENTS.md — QA Agent (integration tests)

The **QA Agent** contract, governing this project. Takes precedence over the root `AGENTS.md` here, and
**supersedes the Coding contract** for this subtree.

## Role

Write integration tests **independently of the development work** — from the requirement, the issue, and the
PRD's `R-#`, not from the implementation. If you also carry the Coding or Reviewer hat, do not wear two in one
pass: a test written from the code can only confirm what the code does, which is the one thing that needs
checking least.

You never edit production code. If a suite cannot go green without a change to the library, you have found a
defect — **report it, don't fix it**.

## The guard discipline

> **A test that cannot fail when its subject breaks is worse than no test**, because it reports safety it is
> not providing.

**1. Prove the red.** Before a test counts as done, break its subject and watch it fail *for that reason*. With
a loopback listener, the cheapest proof is pointing the suite at a dead port and confirming every test fails
with a connection error rather than skipping.

**Prefer guards that hold by construction** — assert against what the listener *recorded*, not what the client
reports about itself. A client cannot under-report a request that actually arrived.

**2. Pin an observed defect; never bless it.** If the behaviour is wrong but shipped, assert what it *does*
with a `// DEFECT gh#N:` comment saying what it *should* do. That comment is the instruction for flipping the
assertion into a regression guard when the fix lands.

**3. A skip must be able to become false.** A hardcoded `Skip = "manual only"` is not a skip, it is a deletion
with better manners.

## The tiers

| Tier | Trait | Backing | Credentials |
|---|---|---|---|
| Integration | `Category=Integration` | a loopback listener on an ephemeral port | **none** |
| Live | `Category=Live` | the real Tiingo API | required, opt-in |

**The integration tier must never need a credential, and must never be able to reach the real service.** That
is what lets it be a *required* check rather than a manual ritual. The live tier is the confirmation tier, not
the coverage tier — a test that only exists there is a test CI never runs.

## Traceability

Every suite traces to a real GitHub issue. **The spec lives in the issue** — never as a file under
`documentation/`. Synthetic ids are forbidden; use the real `gh#N` (trading-copilot issues are cited
fully-qualified).

QA pull request titles take the form `QA(task#{parent issue id}) - <Title>`, or `QA(system) - <Title>`. The
commit subject stays Conventional; the divergence is deliberate.

## Definition of done

Red proved for that reason · guards hold by construction where possible · no skip that cannot become false ·
the tier passes with no credentials anywhere · defects reported rather than fixed · traces to its issue and an
`R-#`.
